# The Circuit Trails

The Circuit is Greater Philadelphia’s multi–use trail network connecting people to jobs, communities, parks, and waterways. Governments, non-profits, and foundations have collaborated to complete over 300 miles of the envisioned 750-mile regional network. More miles are added to the network each year.
